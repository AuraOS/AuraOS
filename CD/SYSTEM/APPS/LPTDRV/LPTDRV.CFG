Here you can program LPTDRV to work by itself. You have to enter at least
one time variable, the port and the pin (D0..D7) which will have to change.
The syntax is as following:
DD,MM,YYYY,hh,mm,ss,P,D,S

Where DD is the day of the month, MM is the month, YYYY is the year,
hh the hour, mm the minutes, ss the seconds, P the port to affect (1 for
0x3BC, 2 for 0x387, 3 for 0x287), D the pin (0 to 7) and S the state to 
force (1 for High or 0 for Low). If you don't want for example to enter a 
specific month and year (to have a daily cycle), enter -1 for month and year.
